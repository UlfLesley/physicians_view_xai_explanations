# LIME and DiCE explainers for XGBoost on Prostate cancer dataset

This is the software repository for my work that evaluates physicians' perspectives on Explainable AI (XAI) explanations, using DiCE and LIME as examples. The aim of the research was to make XAI more useful in real clinical healthcare settings.

Physicians were given the choice of dataset from one of prostate cancer, heart problems, diabetes, dementia, and emergency department triage. The general structure of the code is similar, so only prostate cancer is presented here.
